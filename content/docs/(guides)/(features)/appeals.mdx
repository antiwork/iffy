Iffy provides an appeals system where suspended users can request reinstatement. Review and manage these appeals from your dashboard.

## Appeals dashboard

Navigate to **Inbox** to see pending appeals. Each appeal shows:

- User's email
- Appeal submission time
- Related flagged content
- Appeal message

## Appeal states

| State    | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Open     | New appeal awaiting review            |
| Rejected | Appeal denied, user remains suspended |
| Approved | Appeal accepted, user reinstated      |

## Review process

1. Select an appeal from the inbox
2. Review the flagged content and user's message
3. Choose an action:
   - **Unsuspend**: Approve appeal and reinstate user
   - **Reject**: Deny appeal and maintain suspension

All appeal decisions trigger notifications to the user via email.
