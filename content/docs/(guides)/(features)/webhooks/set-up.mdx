### Step 2: Create a webhook

1. Click Edit webhook
2. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., https://yourapp.com/webhooks/iffy)
3. Click Save webhook
4. Store the generated secret securely - you'll need it to verify webhook signatures

### Step 3: Implement webhook handling

Now that you've configured your webhook URL, you'll need to set up your application to properly consume webhook events. These events will notify you when content is flagged, users are suspended, and other important moderation actions occur.
