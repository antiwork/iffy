## Prerequisites

- **Iffy Account**: You need an Iffy account to access the dashboard and API keys. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://accounts.iffy.com/sign-up).
- **API Key**: An API key is required to authenticate your API requests.

## Step 1: Sign in to your Iffy account

Visit the [Iffy Sign-In page](https://accounts.iffy.com/sign-in) and log in with your credentials.

## Step 2: Create an API key

To interact with the Iffy API, you'll need to create an API key.

1. Navigate to the Developer section in your dashboard or go directly [here](https://iffy.com/dashboard/developer).

3. Provide a name for your API key (e.g., My First API Key) and click **Create**.

4. Copy the generated API key and store it securely. This key will only be shown once.

## Step 3: Submit content for moderation

Now that you have your API key, you can start submitting content to Iffy for moderation using the `/api/v1/ingest` endpoint.

</Cards>

## Step 4: Handling responses

Iffy processes content asynchronously. After submitting the content, Iffy will begin the moderation process. You can check the status of the moderation through:

- **Dashboard**: View moderation status and details in your Iffy dashboard.
- **Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive notifications when moderation is complete.

## Step 5: Deleting a record (Optional)

If you need to remove a record from the moderation system, you can delete it using our API.

## Additional information

- **Content Accessibility**: If you include imageUrls, ensure that the files are accessible to Iffy for as long as the record exists.
- **User Management**: Providing user information helps in better moderation and managing user actions like suspensions if necessary.
- **Moderation Results**: Moderation decisions are available in the dashboard. Set up webhooks to receive real-time updates.

By following these steps, you can integrate Iffy into your platform and start benefiting from intelligent content moderation. For more detailed information, refer to our API Reference and Endpoint Documentation.
