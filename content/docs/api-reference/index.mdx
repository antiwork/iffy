# Getting started

To integrate with Iffy, you'll use our RESTful API endpoints secured with Bearer token authentication.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.iffy.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. You can obtain your API key from your Iffy dashboard.

Include the API key in the Authorization header of every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Available endpoints

Our API provides endpoints for content moderation management:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Ingest record"
    href="/docs/api-reference/ingest/post"
    description="Create or update content records for moderation"
  />

<Card
  title="Delete record"
  href="/docs/api-reference/ingest/delete"
  description="Remove content records from the moderation system"
/>

  <Card
    title="API specification"
    href="#"
    description="View the complete OpenAPI specification"
  />
</Cards>

## Additional information

- **Content accessibility**: Ensure that any fileUrls provided remain accessible by Iffy for as long as the record exists.
- **Protected users**: Users marked as protected are exempt from certain moderation actions, allowing you to safeguard administrators or trusted users.

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the endpoint documentation above. For any questions or assistance, feel free to [reach out to our support team](mailto:support@iffy.com).
